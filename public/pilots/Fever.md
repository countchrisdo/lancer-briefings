Fever is from a world controlled by the **Karrakin Baronies**. She was once an **Ungrateful**, the freedom fighters who sought to undermine the Baronies and tear down their oppressive regime. The cell she was a part of traveled in secret to a world under Baronic domination, aiming to undermine them. Fever, being adept at manipulating the Omninet and electronic systems, scoured the Omninet to find interbaronic blackmail, violations of Union Pillars, and even minor dealings with pirates & other criminals; she managed to find quite a lot of damning evidence that could be used to oppose the House controlling that planet. Her Ungrateful cell was poised to strike at their oppressors.

However, she secretly loathed knowing that no matter what the Ungratefuls did, they would only be freeing the generations that come after themselves. She was sick of living in squalor, in hiding, and constantly on the run. She wanted to lively freely, unbound by the constraints of Baronic law & a lack of money. But most of all, she hated having to fight and someday die for a cause that would never give her the freedom of choice in life that she would be giving to others, decades or even centuries later.

She sought the ultimate freedom, the lifestyle that gave her power, money, and every chance to do she damn well wanted to. She became a lancer. Ever since then, Fever never looked back, never even learning what became of her cell.
