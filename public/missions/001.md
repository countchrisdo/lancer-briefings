## We Could Have Handled This by Text

Get in contact with Landmarks' colony, Evergreen, on Hercynia. Integrate yourselves into their hierarchy an restabish order by assisting them with their current distress.

# Rules of engagement
1. Union’s imperative dictates that the Company treat the
situation with utmost care. Hercynia is potentially
populated by some sort of indigenous human
culture, but the evidence is unclear.

2. The current holder of Hercynia’s charter is
Landmark Colonial, a subsidiary of Smith-
Shimano Corpro. The Company are to make contact
with Landmark’s representative on the ground
first in order to present their credentials and
integrate into the local hierarchy.

3. Hercynia was once subject to a widespread and
catastrophic SecComm expeditionary campaign.
The records lack detail, but building from what
has been recovered from the old Union Colonial
Mission indicates that the Second Committee
mounted a handful of similar campaigns against
resistant populations. This likely accounts for the
massive amount of radiation, distress signals,
encrypted comms, and general “noise” coming
off the world. The Company should expect to
encounter old Union military infrastructure in the
form of unexploded ordinance, waste radiation,
and possibly even abandoned ground-based
installations.
